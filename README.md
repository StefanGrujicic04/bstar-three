# B*-Tree

A C++ implementation of a **B\*-Tree** index structure optimized for block storage and efficient key insertion, redistribution, and splitting operations.  
Implements dynamic node linking, promotion logic, and balanced block utilization according to the B\*-Tree 2/3 fill rule.

- **Block-based structure** with configurable node capacity
- **Search**, **insert**, and **traverse** operations
- Modular **`Node`** and **`BStarTree`** classes with OOP design
- Optional file-based persistence (I/O simulation)
